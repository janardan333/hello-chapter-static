                            (e.g. page views, frequency of access) to track
                            the overall site performance. We further use
                            respective web beacons to gather information to
                            allow us to tune and improve our users’

                        <p>Hello Chapter does not intend the Website and
                            Services to be used by individuals under the age
                            of majority within the jurisdiction within which
                            they reside without the supervision of a parent
                            or guardian of majority age. Hello Chapter
                            relies upon such parents or guardians to
                            determine if the Website and Services are
                            appropriate for the viewing, access, or
                            participation by such individuals under the age
                            of majority. If an individual under the age of
                            majority uses the Website and Services, such
                            individual may only use the Website and Services
                            under the supervision of a parent or guardian of
                            majority age.</p>
                        <p>We do not seek or knowingly collect any personal
                            information about children under 18 years of
                            age. If we become aware that we have unknowingly
                            collected personal information from a child
                            under the age of 18, we will make commercially
                            reasonable efforts to delete such information
                            from our database.</p>
                        <p>If you are the parent or guardian of a minor
                            child who has provided us with personal
                            information, you may contact us using the
                            information below to request it be deleted.</p>
                        <p>Security Policy</p>
                        <p>Before entering certain portions of the site,
                            Users may be required to authenticate their
                            identity. When a User enters sensitive
                            information on the Website, we encrypt that
                            information using encryption techniques such as
                            secure socket layer technology (SSL) <strong>[Note:
                                Please confirm whether you intend to have
                                SSL]</strong>. To learn more about SSL,
                            follow this link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer/"
                                target="_blank"><strong>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer</strong></a>.
                            We follow generally accepted industry standards
                            to protect the personal information submitted to
                            us, both during transmission and while
                            maintaining this information. However, no method
                            of transmission over the Internet, or method of
                            electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore,
                            while we strive to use commercially acceptable
                            means to protect your personal information, we
                            cannot and do not guarantee the information’s
                            absolute security.</p>
                        <p>In the event that the Website undergoes a
                            security systems breach, we may attempt to
                            notify you electronically through the contact
                            information you provide so that you can take
                            appropriate steps to protect yourself from
                            future harm. &nbsp;Additionally, we may also
                            post a notice on or through the Website in such
                            an event. &nbsp;Depending on where you live, you
                            may have a legal right to receive notice of a
                            security breach in writing.</p>
                        <p>While it is difficult to guarantee that your
                            personal information is secure, there are steps
                            to take which can minimize such risk. For
                            instance, passwords containing uppercase and
                            lowercase letters, as well as numbers and
                            symbols are viewed as harder to be “hacked”.
                            Similarly, the risk to your computer from
                            external attacks by malicious users can be
                            reduced through usage of an active firewall. As
                            a further means of protection, please logout
                            anytime you are finished with a session.</p>
                        <p>You should also be aware of fraudulent attempts
                            to gain access to your account information, such
                            as “phishing.” Phishing&nbsp;refers to an email
                            that attempts to fraudulently acquire personal
                            information from you, such as your username,
                            password and/or financial information. These
                            emails appear to be from legitimate companies or
                            individuals, but are not. Hello Chapter will
                            never send you an email asking for your password
                            or login information. &nbsp;In general, you can
                            protect yourself against phishing by providing
                            personal or login information only on the
                            Website from which the email is purportedly
                            sent.</p>
